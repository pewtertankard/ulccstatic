            <h1>Join Us</h1>

            <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Anyone who wishes to join the choir please <a href="contacts.html">contact</a> the secretary and then
                introduce themselves at a rehearsal - there are no formal auditions, although the Director of Music
                reserves the right to do a &OpenCurlyQuote;music test&CloseCurlyQuote;. If you have sung in a church choir before, all the better, but
                we have members who have never before sung in a small choir. The ability to read music is an advantage.
            </p>
            <p>As an independent choir we survive by subscription - the current rate is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>&pound;45 per year for the unwaged.</li>
                <li>For those in salaried employment, a minimum of &pound;95 per annum.</li>
                <li>For those that can afford it, a rate of &pound;135 per annum is suggested as it helps us grow and
                    support our work even further.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A new member is not expected to pay a subscription for their first term, but then they do not have the
                voting rights of a full member.</p>
            <p>Although we are predominately an adult choir, we have a <a href="safeguarding.html">Child Protection and
                    Safeguarding Policy</a>. All new and current members must familiarise themselves with this policy
                which may be found <a href="safeguarding.html">here</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Rehearsals</h2>
            <p>The ULCC meets from 7.15pm until about 9pm nearly every Friday in term time at <a href="stmaryseversholtstreet.html">St Mary's, Somers Town
                (Eversholt Street)</a>; please check the choir <a href="calendar.html">calendar</a> to see the dates and
                times of rehearsals. Eversholt Street is on the east side of Euston station. St Mary's is opposite
                Barnby Street, on the corner of Aldenham Street, half-way to Mornington Crescent. After the rehearsals
                we usually go for a drink and possibly a meal.</p>
