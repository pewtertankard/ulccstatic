            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p>The University of London Church Choir (ULCC) is a choir of graduates and students
                who live and work in and around London. We sing church services at places in and
                around London where there is either no regular choir, or where the regular choir
                is unable to perform. We aim to sing a service or concert every three to four weeks
                during the University term.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
            <p>The University of London Church Choir (ULCC) was formed in July 1992, when the
                University of London Anglican chaplaincy decided to stop having weekly services
                at Christ the King, Gordon Square. The choir had been built up over many years
                as a group of like minded individuals dedicated to singing at University services.
                We felt that such a group must not be allowed to die, so the ULCC was formed with
                the help of several of the chaplains. The choir was formally created with a
                constitution and gained charitable status at the beginning of 1993.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Aims</h2>
            <p>The aims of the choir are</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 4rem">&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;... to promote, improve, develop and maintain public
                education in an appreciation of liturgical choral music by the provision of such music for Christian
                Church Services and by presentation of public concerts and recitals.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;<br />
                <em>(From the constitution)</em></p>
            <p>We have tried to maintain a tradition of singing in a &OpenCurlyQuote;collegiate&CloseCurlyQuote; style, with an emphasis on 'good'
                music sung to as high a standard as possible. Each summer we have sung a week's services at a cathedral
                (including Truro, Ripon, Salisbury, Gloucester, York, Winchester, Dublin, Lincoln, Durham, St Davids,
                Wells, Chester, Hereford, Lichfield, Ely, Norwich, Chichester and Exeter) to rave reviews and many of
                our services are as repeat events. Other tours have included Essex, Düsseldorf/Köln and Paris.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Membership</h2>
            <p>There are currently about 30 members, mostly made up of graduates and undergraduates of the University of
                London. Amongst our number are doctors, solicitors, editors, teachers, accountants, as well as some
                students! Anyone who wishes to join the choir can either contact a member or turn up at a rehearsal and
                introduce themselves - there are no formal auditions, although the Director of Music reserves the right
                to do a &OpenCurlyQuote;music test&CloseCurlyQuote;. If you have sung in a church choir before, all the better, but we have members who
                have never before sung in a small choir.</p>
            <p>As an independent choir we survive by subscription - the current rates are published <a
                    href="joinus.html">here</a>. New members are not expected to pay a subscription for their first
                term, but then they do not have the voting rights of full members.</p>

            <p>Alternatively, why not come to one of the services at which we're singing and say hello? All public services are
