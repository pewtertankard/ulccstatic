            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p>The University of London Church Choir (ULCC) is a choir of graduates and students
                who live and work in and around London. We sing church services at places in and
                around London where there is either no regular choir, or where the regular choir
                is unable to perform. We aim to sing a service or concert every three to four weeks
                during the University term.
            </p>
            <h1 class="section-title">History</h1>
            <p>The University of London Church Choir (ULCC) was formed in July 1992, when the
                University of London Anglican chaplaincy decided to stop having weekly services
                at Christ the King, Gordon Square. The choir had been built up over many years
                as a group of like minded individuals dedicated to singing at University services.
                We felt that such a group must not be allowed to die, so the ULCC was formed with
                the help of several of the chaplains. The choir was formally created with a
                constitution and gained charitable status at the beginning of 1993.
