            <h1>ULCC Safeguarding Policy</h1>

            <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p>ULCC is committed to taking all reasonable measures to ensure that the risks of harm to
                children’s welfare are minimised.</p>
            <p>The Choir recognises its duty of care towards the children to see that all young people’s rights
                to protection from abuse are upheld.</p>
            <p>The Choir recognises that all suspicions or allegations of abuse will be taken seriously and
                responded to swiftly and appropriately.</p>
            <p>The Choir accepts that all Choir members have a duty of care to abide by this policy and to
                report concerns. All Choir members and officers are required to familiarise themselves with this
                CPP document.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Code of Behaviour</h2>
            <p>The Choir recognises that there may be a necessity for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/dbs">DBS</a> checks in certain situations and will
                undertake to have these put in place where the need arises.</p>
            <p>All children will be treated with respect at all times, regardless of age, sex or ethnicity. Any child or
                young person in performance with the Choir is a valued member of the entire team and as such is of equal
                importance to any other performer. </p>
            <p>At the same time, the Choir expects similar respectful behaviour from the children. </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Procedures</h2>
            <p>Any expression of concern regarding either a child, or a Choir member, will immediately be reported to
                the designated Choir members who will in turn report to the Chair of the Choir and in conference with
                them decide on the most suitable course of action to resolve the problem.</p>
            <p>The reported problem will immediately be logged.</p>
            <p>Confidentiality for all parties will be maintained at every stage of such an event.</p>
            <p>Please see below for named persons and contact details.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Responding to Reports of Abuse from a Child</h2>
            <p>The Choir notes the importance of being alert to signals of abuse, to the difficulty children may have in
                reporting it, and to responding appropriately to a child who has a complaint.</p>
            <p>Some helpful responses</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remain calm, accessible and receptive</li>
                <li>Listen carefully without interrupting.</li>
                <li>Be aware of the non-verbal messages you are giving.</li>
                <li>Make it clear that you are taking them seriously.</li>
                <li>Acknowledge their courage and reassure them they are right to tell.</li>
                <li>Reassure them that they should not feel guilty and that you’re sorry that this has happened to them.
                </li>
                <li>Avoid leading questions.</li>
                <li>Tell the child what you are going to do next.</li>
                <li>Write down what was said and who was present, using the child’s actual words wherever possible.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Dissemination of Policy</h2>
            <p>New members will be required to familiarise themselves with this policy upon joining the choir.</p>
