      <h1>ULCC</h1>

      <h2 class="section-title">Welcome</h2>
      <p>The University of London Church Choir (ULCC) is a choir of graduates and students who live and work in and
        around London. We sing church services at places in and around London where there is either no choir, or where
        the regular choir is unable to perform. We aim to sing a service or concert every three to four weeks during the
        University term.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 4rem">&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;...the sung delivery was fantastic. The Howells in particular
        was heavenly.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;<br />

        <div>I Was Glad
          by Henry Purcell

          performed by ULCC in
          the Lady Chapel of
          Liverpool Cathedral
          August 2016
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div>In fact, do you
          love church
          music in the
          English Choral
          tradition as
          much as we
          do?
        </div>
        <div>If yes, then
          why not
          join us?

          We’re
          recruiting
          now.
        </div>
        <div>Do you love
          singing and are
          you in the 
          London area?
        </div>
        <div>Enjoying this?</div>
        <div>But,
          who or what is the
          University of London Church Choir?
        </div>
        <div>We’re a friendly bunch and welcome new singers, of any age, whether experienced or not.
        </div>
        <div>We also perform occasional concerts and, at least once per year, we tour outside London.
        </div>
        <div>Sing joyfully!
        </div>
        <div>We sing church services in and around London where there’s no regular choir or where the regular choir is
          unable to perform.
        </div>
        <div>You don’t have to be a student or associated with the University of London at all.
          Don’t be confused by our name. If you love singing, we’d love to meet you.
        </div>
        <div>We sing at several services every term, including usually one service at Southwark Cathedral.
        </div>
        <div>Recent tours have been to Exeter, Durham and Liverpool Cathedrals and to St Thomas’ Fifth Avenue, New York.

        </div>
        <div>We’re a group of amateur singers who are passionate about singing English Choral music in its proper
          liturgical setting.</div>

      <h2 class="section-title">News</h2>
      <p>
        We're back online...! After that recent hacking incident (calm... calm... remember <a
          href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A37&version=KJV">Luke 6:37</a>) we're back up and
        on the Interwebs. We're perhaps not as fully functional as in times gone by but in good shape for the future as
        we rebuild piece by piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, we're on the cusp of our summer tour to Gloucester Cathedral, singing the services for the
        week. More details <a href="calendar.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we've got the term dates for the new academic year, you'll be the first to know... OK, the Director of
        Music will be first to know... then the secretary, then perhaps the Webmaster and then, very soon afterwards, so
        will you. Watch this space... not constantly of course... I'm sure you have better things to do... pop back
        often. We're not going away (not this time!).
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Thanks for stopping by</h2>
      <p>We would like to welcome all those, whether new to London or not, who would like to <a href="joinus.html">join
          us</a>. If you're interested in doing so or just want to know more about us, please <a
          href="contacts.html">contact us</a>.</p>
