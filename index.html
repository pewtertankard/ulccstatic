      <p>The University of London Church Choir (ULCC) is a choir of graduates and students who live and work in and
        around London. We sing church services at places in and around London where there is either no choir, or where
        the regular choir is unable to perform. We aim to sing a service or concert every three to four weeks during the
        University term.</p>

        was heavenly.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;<br />

      <h2 class="section-title">News</h2>
      <p>
        As you are no doubt aware, the ongoing Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a cessation of public
        services of worship and this, of course, includes cancelling all our near-to planned events. We will soon be able to
        confirm if we can continue with our summer tour in August at Wells Cathedral and, hopefully, our planned weekend in
        Bradford Cathedral this July.  For more details, see <a href="calendar.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, full rehearsals are, of course, not able to occur right now. Our planned next full rehearsal is therefore
        the beginning of the next academic year, <a href="calendar.html">Friday, the 25th of September 2020</a>.
        However, rehearsals have <i>not</i> stopped. They've just gone online!  If you'd like to know more or were wondering
        about joining us, just get in touch, details are <a href="joinus.html">here</a>.
