      <h1>ULCC</h1>

      <h2 class="section-title">Welcome</h2>
      <p>The University of London Church Choir (ULCC) is a choir of graduates and students who live and work in and
        around London. We sing church services at places in and around London where there is either no choir, or where
        the regular choir is unable to perform. We aim to sing a service or concert every three to four weeks during the
        University term.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 4rem">&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;...the sung delivery was fantastic. The Howells in particular
        was heavenly.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;<br />
        <em>(From &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;The Mystery Worshipper&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; at The Ship of Fools)</em></p>

       <h2 class="section-title">News</h2>
      <p>
        We're back online...! After that recent hacking incident (calm... calm... remember <a
          href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A37&version=KJV">Luke 6:37</a>) the Web site is back up and
        on the Interwebs. It's perhaps not as fully functional as in times gone by but in good shape for the future as
        we rebuild piece by piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, the choir is on the cusp of our summer tour to Gloucester Cathedral, singing the services for the
        week. More details <a href="calendar.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we've got the term dates for the new academic year, you'll be the first to know... OK, the Director of
        Music will be first to know... then the secretary, then perhaps the Webmaster and then, very soon afterwards, so
        will you. Watch this space... not constantly of course... I'm sure you have better things to do... pop back
        often. We're not going away (not this time!).
      </p>
